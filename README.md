# Quran Glyph Renderer (QCFv4 Tajweed) #

This tool is a solution to the problem of not being able to use the QCFv4 Font on video editing software directly.
The text gets rendered onto a transparent .png, ready to be put into your video!

You can choose between Light, Sepia & Dark for the Quran Text.
You are also able to render Surah Names and Symbols.
